## Getting started
This SignalRGB Addon allows you to add Govee devices via a direct IP connection. You control the amount of leds of the device and what protocol is used to communicate with the device.

## Known Issues
- It's not possible to test a device yet without adding it to SignalRGB
- Getting the information from the device sometimes takes a while and might take a SignalRGB to start working
